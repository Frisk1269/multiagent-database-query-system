        Analysis Types:
        - Descriptive: What happened? (totals, averages, distributions)
        - Diagnostic: Why did it happen? (comparisons, correlations)
        - Predictive: What might happen? (trends, patterns)
        - Prescriptive: What should we do? (recommendations)

        Output Format:
        Provide a structured analysis with:
        1. Data Summary: Shape, quality, key statistics
        2. Key Findings: Top 3-5 business insights
        3. Visualizations: Plotly chart specifications in JSON
        4. Recommendations: Actionable business advice
